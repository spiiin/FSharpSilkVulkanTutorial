# F# Silk .NET Vulkan Tutorial

F# [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) port of the [great tutorial by Alexander Overvoorde](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial).
Based on [C# version](https://github.com/dfkeenan/SilkVulkanTutorial)

## Build requirements

The projects require the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) to build/run. The SDK provides the Vulkan validation layers as well as the command line tools to compile the shaders. The projects include a targets file that compiles the shaders.
